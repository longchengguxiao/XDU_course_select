# XDU_course_select
This is a simple script for XDUers to select their favoriate courses.

## Requirments
You can use command"pip install requirments.txt" to install these library.
And I suggest you use the version 3.8 of Python

## Config
open the config.json and fill it with your information
there are specific descripations to tell you what should be filled there.

## Run
Open the terminal and input command "python xk.py".
And then, drinking a cup of tea to waste your spare time.

## The purpose
This scrpit, which I write to use to rush course before the deadline, is not for money.
And I open it source to avoid someone use the script for money.
